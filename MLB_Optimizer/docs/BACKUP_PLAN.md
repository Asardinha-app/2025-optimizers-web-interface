# MLB Optimizer Backup Plan

## Current State
- Original files remain in their current locations
- New structure created alongside existing structure
- No files have been moved yet

## Backup Strategy

### Phase 1: Safe Creation ✅
- [x] New directory structure created
- [x] __init__.py files added
- [x] Placeholder files created
- [x] No existing files modified

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Next)
- [ ] Move files one by one
- [ ] Update imports after each move
- [ ] Test functionality after each move
- [ ] Keep original files as backup

### Phase 3: Validation (Future)
- [ ] Test all functionality in new structure
- [ ] Verify performance is maintained
- [ ] Confirm all features work
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Future)
- [ ] Remove old files only after validation
- [ ] Update all references
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Use original file locations
2. **Import Fixes**: Update imports back to original paths
3. **Testing**: Verify all functionality restored
4. **Documentation**: Update docs to reflect original structure

## Current File Locations

### Original Structure (Preserved)
- `MLB_Optimizer.py` - Main optimizer
- `MLB_Late_Swap_Optimizer.py` - Late swap optimizer
- `Scrapes/` - Data scrapers
- `late_swap/` - Late swap components
- `automation/` - Automation scripts
- `documentation/` - Documentation
- `logs/` - Log files

### New Structure (Created)
- `core/` - Core optimizer components
- `data/` - Data processing components
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `tests/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `scripts/` - CLI entry points

## Next Steps

1. **Review new structure** - Ensure it meets requirements
2. **Plan file moves** - Create detailed migration plan
3. **Begin migration** - Move files one by one
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify all functionality
5. **Update documentation** - Reflect new structure

## Safety Measures

- ✅ Original files untouched
- ✅ New structure created safely
- ✅ Backup plan documented
- ✅ Rollback strategy ready
- ✅ Testing plan in place

---
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Safe Structure Created
**Next Action**: Review and approve migration plan
**Risk Level**: Very Low (no files moved yet)
