# MLB Late Swap Optimizer - Issue Fix Plan

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Salary Cap Violations ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Lineups exceeding $35,000 salary cap, causing optimization failures
**Root Cause**: Test template creation not properly validating salary constraints
**Impact**: Multi-swap optimization fails with INFEASIBLE status
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Enhanced salary validation in test template creation

### Issue 2: Slot Assignment Failures ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: "Could not assign slot for player" errors during parsing
**Root Cause**: Slot assignment logic not handling all player position combinations
**Impact**: Lineups fail to parse, reducing processing success rate
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Enhanced position matching with flexible rules

### Issue 3: Duplicate Player ID Problem ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple players with same ID causing parsing conflicts
**Root Cause**: CSV loading mechanism losing data due to duplicate column names
**Impact**: Parser receives incomplete lineup data
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Switched to pandas for CSV loading, preserving all columns

### Issue 4: Insufficient Stacking ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Lineups not maintaining proper team stacking
**Root Cause**: Stack identification logic not working correctly
**Impact**: Reduced lineup optimization potential
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Enhanced stack identification and preservation

### Issue 5: Multi-swap Optimization Failures ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: OR-Tools optimization failing with INFEASIBLE status
**Root Cause**: Poor candidate filtering and position matching
**Impact**: No swaps found even when valid candidates exist
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Enhanced candidate filtering and position matching

### Issue 6: Player ID Parsing Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent player ID formats causing parsing errors
**Root Cause**: Parser not handling various ID formats correctly
**Impact**: Lineup parsing failures
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Enhanced ID parsing with flexible format handling
